# PostImages.org Upload Mechanism Research Findings

## Overview
PostImages.org is a free image hosting service that allows users to upload images. Based on the Python client library analysis, I've identified the upload endpoint and mechanism.

## Key Findings

### Upload Endpoint
- **URL**: `https://postimg.cc/json/rr`
- **Method**: POST
- **Type**: Multipart form data

### Other Endpoints
- **Login Page**: `https://postimages.org/login`
- **Galleries**: `https://postimg.cc/files`
- **Gallery Token**: `https://postimg.cc/gallery`

### Anonymous Upload Support
- PostImages.org supports **anonymous uploads** (no login required)
- This is ideal for client-side JavaScript implementation
- Users mentioned in forums that they can upload using curl without authentication

## Implementation Strategy

Since the Python library requires authentication and server-side processing, we need to:

1. **Use anonymous upload** - PostImages.org supports anonymous uploads via their web interface
2. **Reverse engineer the web upload form** - Inspect the actual postimages.org website to see how they handle uploads from the browser
3. **Implement client-side upload** - Use JavaScript FormData to upload images directly from the browser

## Next Steps
1. Visit postimages.org and inspect the network traffic during an upload
2. Identify the exact form fields and headers required
3. Implement the upload functionality in JavaScript
